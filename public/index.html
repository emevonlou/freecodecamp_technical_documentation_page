                    The shell is the layer that surrounds the kernel(core operating system. It is he who talks to the
                    hardware indicating what should be done.).the shell is
                    the command interpreter that transmits to the kernel what is to be performed. </p>

                <p>
                    Unix is an operating system, all SHARCNET systems run some variant of Unix (eg. Linux)
                    Most Unix-based systems have a GUI interface, but the command line offers more complex and abstract
                    interactions with far less effort
                    At login the system starts a shell process for you which acts as your command line interpreter to
                    interface with the operating system
                    Borne Again Shell ( bash ) is the default shell at SHARCNET
                    Common terms
                    File
                    data stored in a standard format that behaves in a certain way depending on it’s function in the
                    system; everything is a file in Unix
                    Program
                    a file that can be executed (run)
                    Process
                    a program that is being executed (eg. your computing job is made of one or more processes)
                    Ownership
                    files/programs/processes are owned by a user and group
                    Hierarchical Directory Structure
                    files are organized in directories (folders) that can have a parent, eg. /home/$USER/sim1
                    The base of the hierarchy is root , ie: / (forward-slash)
                    Managing your files and processes is crucial to effectively using the systems!

                </p>

                <h4>Executing Commands:</h4>

                <p> To run a command you simply type its name in and hit Enter↲
                    The command must be in your $PATH and be executable (we’ll get to that later…)
                    General syntax of a command:
                    <br /> <br />
                    <code>
                        $ command [[-]option(s)] [option argument(s)] [command argument(s)]
                    </code>

                    <br />
                    <ol>
                        <li> command: the name of the command or utility: ls, man, cat, mv</li>

                        <li> options: change the behaviour of the basic command: ls -l vs. ls
                            may or may not be preceded by “-”</li>

                        <li> option arguments: change the behaviour of an option: tail –c 5 file1 vs. tail –c 15 file1
                        </li>

                        <li> command arguments: what is affected by the command, usually files or the output of another
                            command</li>


                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>Basic Comands:</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li> Getting help with commands (the most important command!):</li>
                        man

                        <li>Figuring out who we are and where we are:</li>
                        whoami, hostname, date

                        <li>Navigating directories:</li>
                        cd, pwd

                        <li>Manipulating files and directories:</li>
                        cp, mv, rm, rmdir, mkdir

                        <li>Listing files and their properties:</li>
                        ls, file

                        <li>Displaying the contents of files:</li>
                        cat, tail, head, more, wc

                        <li>Investigating running programs:</li>
                        ps, top


                    </ul>

                <h4>Key Features</h4>
                <p>Unix Architecture page on Wikipedia
                    <br /><br />
                    Files are stored on disk in a hierarchical file system, with a single top location throughout the
                    system (root, or "/"), with both files and directories, subdirectories, sub-subdirectories, and so
                    on below it.
                    With few exceptions, devices and some types of communications between processes are managed and
                    visible as files or pseudo-files within the file system hierarchy. This is known as everything's a
                    file.

                    Doug McIlroy (inventor of Unix pipes)

                    This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work
                    together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface
                </p>
                <h4>File system</h4>

                <p> Key differences from Windows
                    <br />
                    <ul>
                        <li>there are mount points instead of A:, C:, etc.</li>
                        <li>directories and files are case sensitive</li>

                <header>Linux and vi Editor Fundamentals</header>
                <hr>
                <h4>Objectives</h4>

                <p>This self-directed tutorial is mainly for people who have none or very little experience in Linux
                    system, particularly for Windows users who want to migrate to SHARCNET Linux systems. Examples shown
                    in the lightgrey areas were run on 'narwhal', a SHARCNET cluster. We hope that this tutorial would
                    be a good starting point for newcomers to Linux.</p>
                <h4>What is Linux?</h4>
                <p>Linux is a free Unix-type operating system originally created by Linus Torvalds with the assistance
                    of developers around the world in the 90's. Linux is becoming popular as a powerful, low-cost
                    operating system for cluster servers.
                </p>
                <h4>Linux Features</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        multitasking: Several programs running at once
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        multiusers: Several users at the same machine at once
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Multiplatforms: it runs on many different CPU
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <header>Environment variables, initialization, and scripts</header>
                <hr>
                <h4>Environment variables</h4>
                <p>The shell environment allows one to store values in environment variables
                    Many are provided by default when you login, eg. $USER , $HOME , $PWD , $PATH
                    $ expands the value of a variable:</p>
                <code>beaker@dtn:~$ echo $PATH
                        <br/>
                        /bin:/usr/bin
                    </code>
                <p>The export command allows one to set new variables or modify existing ones, for example, to add a
                    directory to the beginning of your $PATH environment variable:</p>
                <code>
                            beaker@dtn:~$ export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH<br/>
                            beaker@dtn:~$ echo $PATH<br/>
                            /home/beaker/bin:/bin:/usr/bin
                    </code>
                <h4>Command aliases</h4>
                <p>The alias command allows you to build new commands
                    <br />For example, one can set up an alias to run a command with particular, common switches:</p>
                <code>alias lsfull=’ls -larth’</code>
                <p>Now when one runs lsfull it will automatically expand to execute ls with the -larth switches /
                    options<br />
                    One can also use environment variables and pipes, etc.:
                    <br /><br />
                    <code>
                                    alias wh='echo "["$USER"] ["$HOSTNAME"] ["$PWD"] ["`date`"] ["`uptime`"]"'<br/>
                                    alias psme='ps aux | grep $USER | grep -v grep'
                            </code></p><br /><br />

                <header>How to configure vi/vim</header>
                <hr>
                <h4>Introduction</h4>

                <p>The vim console text editor can be started by typing vim.
                    A graphical version is also available on most Sharcnet systems: gvim.
                    For a complete list of command line options run the command vim -h or read the manpage by executing
                    man vim.
                </p>

                <h4>Version Selection</h4>
                <p>Note that vim is provided as part of the default user environment on all sharcnet systems so its not
                    necessary to load a vim module before using it.
                    o On the remaining XC cluster, requin, vim 7.2 is installed as a module and loaded by default. Note
                    that one can do "module unload vim" to fall back to the default 6.3 system version.</p>
                <h4>Job Submission</h4>
                <p>Not applicable.</p>

                <h4>General Notes</h4>
                <p>Different systems may have different versions of vi and vim. While it is useful to know the original
                    set of vi commands and behavior when dealing with older systems, most modern systems use vim. On
                    SHARCNET systems vi is actually an alias to vim.
                </p>
                <code>Configuring vim: ~/.vimrc</code>
                <p>To ensure you have a consistent vim experience across systems it is recommended that you create a
                    personal
                    vim configuration file in your home directory:</p><br />
                <code>/home/$USER/.vimrc</code>
                <p>You can set configuration statements in this file to change the behavior of the vim editing
                    environment at initialization. Here is an example file:</p>
                <code>
                        [snuser@nar317 ~]$ cat ~/.vimrc<br/>
                        set nocompatible<br/>
                        set autoindent<br/>
                        set smartindent<br/>
                        set tabstop=4<br/>
                        set shiftwidth=4<br/>
                        set showmatch<br/>
                        set ruler<br/>
                        set incsearch<br/>
                        syntax on<br/>
                        [snuser@nar317 ~]$<br/>
                </code>
